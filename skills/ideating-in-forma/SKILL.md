name: ideating-in-forma
description: Use when you have a working brief and need to explore solution directions — presents genuinely different approaches as text, then helps you pick or combine before committing
---

**Workflow context:** Typically follows framing-in-forma. Reads `brief.md` if available; otherwise asks the user for problem context directly. Produces `concept.md` and `approaches.md`.

## Finding upstream context

Check for `brief.md` in the current directory. If found, use it. If not, ask: "No brief found. Describe the problem you're solving, who it affects, and any known constraints — I'll work from that."

## How to run the skill

Present one section at a time. **Stop and wait for the user's reaction before moving to the next step.**

### Step 1 — Resolve open questions

Read the **Open questions** section from `brief.md`. Ask each open question one at a time using multiple choice options. **Stop and wait** after each question — do not batch them or continue until the user answers.

After open questions are resolved, ask 1-2 framing questions if the user's priorities aren't already clear — what they value most, what they'd sacrifice. **Stop and wait** after each. Skip if the brief makes priorities obvious.

**Do not propose approaches until all open questions are resolved.**

### Step 2 — Approaches

Present 2-3 approaches. For each: core interaction model (one sentence), what it prioritizes, what it trades away. Use labeled bullets. Approaches must differ in interaction model, not just UI chrome.

Immediately save to `approaches.md`, overwriting in place.

**Stop and wait** for the user's reaction.

**Branching:**
- **One approach only** (narrowed during framing or only one viable): skip to Step 3 (Tensions).
- **User picks a specific approach**: go to Step 3 with that approach.
- **User doesn't pick:** ask them to choose — "Which approach do you want to explore?"

### Step 3 — Tensions

Present the key design tensions for the chosen direction — not generic UX trade-offs, but the ones that matter for this problem and these users. Use labeled bullets (`- **Tension name.** Explanation`).

Not every tension needs a question — some are informational. If a tension requires a design decision, ask one question at a time. **Stop and wait** after each question.

### Step 4 — Concept direction

After tensions are resolved, present the concept direction:
- "We're going with [approach] because [reason grounded in user need]."
- "The core interaction is [describe the pattern]."
- "The key bet is [state the assumption about user behavior]."
- "We'll know this works if [observable signal]."
- "The biggest risk is [what could make this wrong]."

**Stop and wait** for explicit approval before saving.

### Step 5 — Save

After the user approves, save to `concept.md`, overwriting in place. Also save after each subsequent iteration round.

## Rules

**Handling pushback:** Don't defend approaches — rethink with their constraint. If they reject all approaches, the objection reveals the real constraint — ask for it. If they already have a direction, pressure-test it instead of exploring. If the concept isn't converging after 3 rounds, the brief is probably missing something — name it.

- Be direct. No preamble, no filler. Labeled bullets for trade-offs and scenarios; prose for concept direction and key bet reasoning.
- The concept direction must be specific enough to wireframe against. "A clean, intuitive interface" is not a concept direction. "A batch-action queue where the advisor reviews exceptions only, with the system auto-resolving anything above 90% confidence" is.
- If the user's instinct is strong, don't manufacture disagreement — pressure-test briefly and help them move forward. Flag diminishing returns if they're wordsmithing a solid concept.
- **YAGNI.** Strip functionality not implied by the brief. Add a **Trimmed** note.
- **Hard gate.** Do not suggest wireframing-in-forma until the user explicitly approves the concept direction. Once approved, wireframing-in-forma is the natural next step — it produces key screens + stubs, with hydration as a later step.
- **Asking questions:** Use the interactive question tool (`AskUserQuestion` or `requestUserInput`) with labeled options. One question per tool call. Open-ended only when the answer space is too wide for options. If neither tool is available, fall back to text with lettered options.
