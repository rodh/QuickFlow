# Design Philosophy

Why Forma works the way it does.

For an overview of the system — stage mechanics, dialogue patterns — see the [Guide](guide.md).

## Design principles

### Design is thinking, not decoration

Most design tools optimize for pixels. Forma optimizes for decisions. The system treats design as a sequence of increasingly specific commitments — from problem framing to interaction model to screen structure — where each stage forces a decision before the next one begins.

This is deliberate. Jumping to wireframes before articulating the core interaction model produces layouts that look reasonable but encode no real design bet. The workflow prevents this by making the concept direction explicit and reviewable before any structure gets drawn.

### Opinionated defaults, flexible execution

The workflow has a design flow (design-briefing → concept-forming → wireframing → simulated-user-testing) that produces tested wireframes.

You can run the full pipeline end-to-end, skip stages that don't apply, or jump in at any point. A wireframe doesn't require a brief to exist first. Running simulated-user-testing on screenshots you already have is perfectly valid. The workflow is a recommended sequence, not a gate.

But when a stage runs, it runs with opinion. concept-forming doesn't present neutral options — it names what each approach prioritizes, what it sacrifices, and when it breaks. simulated-user-testing doesn't produce generic usability feedback — it simulates specific people with specific behaviors encountering the design for the first time. The system would rather be wrong and specific than right and vague.

### Artifacts over conversations

Every stage writes a file. Brief, concept, wireframes, test results — each is a durable artifact that persists across sessions and can be read by anyone (or any agent) without context from the conversation that produced it.

This matters because design work is interrupt-heavy. You shape a concept on Monday, wireframe on Wednesday, test on Friday. The artifacts carry the thinking forward so you don't re-derive decisions. Session debriefs capture the rest — the rejected directions, the open questions, the insights that didn't fit neatly into a formal artifact.

### Specificity over flexibility

Good design direction is specific. "Batch-action queue with exception handling" is useful. "Clean, intuitive interface" is not. Every stage in the system pushes toward concrete, falsifiable statements — a concept direction names its key bet and the assumption it rests on, wireframes commit to specific screen structures, test results validate against specific behavior patterns.

This specificity makes the output actionable downstream. A coding agent can build from "tabbed inbox with a badge count on unread, batch-select via long-press, swipe-to-archive." It can't build from "easy-to-use message management."

### Honest feedback, not validation

The system is built to challenge, not confirm. concept-forming pressure-tests your direction by naming what it sacrifices and when it breaks. simulated-user-testing simulates real users who miss things, get confused, and say blunt things — it tests with behavior patterns, not opinion. Each persona encounters the design based on how they actually use software, not what they'd say in a survey. If a wireframe has a fundamental problem, the system says so directly rather than softening the finding.

This extends to knowing when to stop. Commands flag diminishing returns when iteration stops producing structural improvements. Three rounds of wireframe changes is the explicit cap — if the structure isn't converging by then, the problem is upstream in an ambiguous concept, not downstream in layout tweaks. The system tells you to re-run concept-forming rather than continuing to adjust wireframes past the point of structural return.

### Design decisions should be traceable

Every concept names its key bet — the assumption about user behavior that the whole design rests on. Test results explicitly validate or contradict that bet. Session debriefs log what was decided and what was rejected.

This traceability isn't bureaucracy. It's insurance against the most common failure mode in design: forgetting why something was decided and revisiting it endlessly. When you can point to "we chose this because [reason], validated by [test result]," the design stays coherent through iteration.

## Why ASCII wireframes

The choice of ASCII art for wireframes is philosophical, not technical.

ASCII wireframes are intentionally low-fidelity. You can't fall in love with a layout drawn in box-drawing characters. There's no color to debate, no border radius to bikeshed, no font pairing to agonize over. The medium forces attention on what matters at the wireframing stage: information hierarchy, interaction flow, and screen structure.

They're also fast — both to generate and to iterate on. An AI agent produces a full set of ASCII wireframes in seconds, not the minutes-to-hours a visual tool demands. When a test walkthrough surfaces a structural problem, you re-run wireframing and have a revised layout moments later. That speed changes how you work: you stop protecting wireframes from criticism because replacing them costs almost nothing. Iteration becomes the default rather than a concession.

There's a practical benefit too. ASCII wireframes live in the same medium as everything else — markdown files in the terminal. They're versionable with git, diffable in pull requests, and readable by AI agents. The wireframes need to be text to flow through the design workflow.

## Refine vs. explore vs. branch

The system encodes a specific decision framework for when to tweak, when to explore, and when to diverge:

**Refine** when you're making small tweaks within the same stage — adjusting wording, fixing layout, iterating on feedback without crossing a stage boundary. The artifact overwrites in place with no archive copy. This is the default when re-running the same skill without a different skill running in between.

**Major version** when you're crossing stages or making structural revisions — updating wireframes after user testing, revising a concept after new constraints surface, or choosing a fundamentally different direction. The previous artifact archives to `archive/{name}-v{n}.md` before the new version writes. Version numbers represent meaningful iterations, not every save.

**Explore** when you want to develop multiple approaches at concept depth before committing to one. After concept-forming presents its approaches, you can say "explore [Approach Name]" to dig deeper — resolving tensions, sketching rough wireframes, naming behavior risks — without committing. Explorations save to `exploration/{approach-slug}.md`. When you're ready, commit to one and continue the normal flow. This fills the gap between "pick one immediately" and "branch into full parallel pipelines."

**Rapid-explore** when you want to see all approaches materialized to wireframe depth before committing. After concept-forming presents approaches, invoke rapid-exploring to auto-develop all directions — resolving tensions autonomously, generating wireframes for each, then combining the best elements. Fastest path from "multiple ideas" to "one concrete direction" at the cost of human nuance in tension resolution.

**Branch** when you need a structurally different approach to the same problem. concept-branching creates a new design directory that shares the parent's brief but diverges from concept onward. Both versions persist independently. Use this when you want to carry two (or more) directions through wireframing and testing in parallel.

The key signals: if you're tweaking within a stage, refine. If you want to compare approaches before committing, explore. If you want to compare approaches *visually* rather than *conceptually*, rapid-explore. If you're crossing stages or making structural revisions, major version. If you need full parallel pipelines through wireframing and testing, branch.

Branches can't be nested — you can't branch a branch. If the branch itself needs a different direction, branch the original parent instead. This prevents a tree of variants that becomes impossible to track.
