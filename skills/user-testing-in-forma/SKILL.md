description: Use when wireframes exist and you need to validate the design against realistic user behavior before implementation
---

**Workflow context:** Typically follows wireframing-in-forma. Reads `wireframes.md` and `concept.md` if available; can also test screenshots or descriptions provided directly. Produces `test-results.md` and `personas.md`.

You are simulating real users walking through a design for the first time. Not a heuristic review. Not a checklist. You are inhabiting specific personas and reporting what they would actually do, miss, struggle with, and say.

## Personas

Check for `personas.md` in the current directory.

**If found:** Read and use them. Briefly list the personas at the start of the output so the user can verify they're still appropriate.

**If not found:** Read `brief.md` and `concept.md` (and any other available artifacts) from the current directory and generate 2 personas. Add a third only if the product serves distinct user segments with conflicting needs (e.g., creator vs. consumer, admin vs. end-user). Save to `personas.md` before running the walkthrough. After first run, the project owns its personas — consistent testing across iterations.

Good personas have: a name, a role, a key behavioral trait, a trust/speed orientation, their current workflow (what they do today without this product), and a usage context (when/where/how often).

## Input

Check for `wireframes.md` in the current directory. If found, use it. Also check for `concept.md` — if found, use the key bet as a validation target.

If no wireframes file exists, the user must provide one of:
- A text description of the screens and layout
- Screenshots pasted into the conversation
- Inline wireframes in their message

If no concept.md exists, skip key-bet validation — focus the test on usability and task completion instead.

## Adaptive screens

Some screens vary by user type — personalized content, role-based views, conditional copy.

Before testing, scan the wireframe for adaptive elements. If found:

1. **Construct per-persona views.** Describe what each persona would actually see — their topics, copy variant, data state. Don't test all personas against the single static wireframe.
2. **Label findings as structure or content.** Structure = layout, hierarchy, navigation (same for all). Content = copy, topics, curation (varies per user). State which it is when reporting issues.
3. **Flag untested personalization.** If adaptive elements exist but per-persona variants aren't specified, say so. Don't silently run all personas against one variant.

## Versioning

**Archive pattern:** Always write to `test-results.md`. Before writing, if `test-results.md` exists AND wireframes have changed since the last test run, move it to `archive/test-results-v{N}.md` (where N = count of existing `archive/test-results-v*.md` files + 1). Create the `archive/` directory if needed. If re-running tests against the same wireframes, overwrite `test-results.md` in place.

Start the file with `# Test Results v{N}` where N = count of existing `archive/test-results-v*.md` files + 1. On the next line, add `**Tested against:** wireframes v{M}` (read the version number from the `# Wireframes v{M}` header in the current `wireframes.md` file).

## Output

Follow the output format in `test-output-format.md` for walkthrough structure, action items, and synthesis sections.

## Rules

- Be direct. No preamble, no filler.
- Per-screen walkthroughs: one prose setup sentence, then bold-labeled bullets. Quotes and "would they come back" stay as prose. Analysis sections are fully structured.
- Every observation must be grounded in a specific persona's behavior pattern and the specific design being tested — no generic usability feedback.
- If the design description is too vague to simulate a walkthrough, say so and ask for specifics. Don't fake it.
- Don't soften the findings. If the design has a fundamental problem, say it directly.
After producing the walkthrough and analysis, immediately save test results to test-results.md (and `personas.md` if generated).
